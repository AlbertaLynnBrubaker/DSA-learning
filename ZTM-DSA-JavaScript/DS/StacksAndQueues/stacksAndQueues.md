# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

If we visit several websites, we add each website to the Stack in the order that we visit them (push). If we then want to navigate back, we remove the most recent site visited from the Stack (pop).

LIFO

discover-aliebrubaker.net <--- top of the Stack. To go back we have to remove this from the Stack
twitter.com
amazon.com
google.com <--- bottom of the Stack

We can build Stacks with Arrays and Linked Lists

## Queues

Queues operate like a line at a shop. As a new person shows up, they go onto the end of the line (enqueue). As a new cash register frees up, the person at the front of the line gets pulled from the line (dequeue).

FIFO

Customer1 <-- Customer2 <-- Customer3

We can build Queues with Linked Lists
